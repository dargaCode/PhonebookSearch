# Phonebook Search
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS+Node</strong>

This project generates, processes, and stores 2,000 fictional people and businesses, using data structures to make them very quickly searchable.

I think this is the most challenging and interesting project Iâ€™ve done so far. It required me to incorporate data structures, Big O, OOP, AJAX, JSON, callbacks, events, recursion, DOM manipulation, and even some new HTML/CSS tricks.

In the real world this app would require some server-side/database work as well, but for my purposes here I simulated that with some Node.js scripts and saved JSON files.
